# LearningWebDev
A journey through learning web development. Projects and exercises built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repository documents my web development journey as I learn and build projects using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies
- **HTML**: Building the structure of web pages.
- **CSS**: Styling web pages for layout, colors, and design.
- **JavaScript**: (Coming Soon) Making web pages interactive and dynamic.

## Projects and Exercises

## Future Plans
- Dive deeper into JavaScript, focusing on DOM manipulation, events, and API integration.
- Learn frameworks like React or Vue to build complex web applications.

Stay tuned for updates as I continue to improve and expand my skills in web development!
